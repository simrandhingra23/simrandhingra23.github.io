<p>We all make mistakes. Sometimes, this happens unnoticed. And sometimes, it doesn’t even matter. But there are some areas where it’s particularly troublesome when we make mistakes. And science, I think, is one such area. Luckily for us, science (and philosophy, I might add) is a collaborative enterprise. And uncovering mistakes is an integral part of it. In this spirit, I invite you to check and replicate my work. To help you with this, I try to maintain <a href="/repositories.html">repositories</a> containing essential files (i.e., primarily data and analysis files) for research projects where I am first or corresponding author.</p>

<h2 id="check-my-work">Check My Work</h2>

<p>Inspired by Gilad Feldman,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I offer to pay you a bounty for every minor or major error you find in my preprinted and published work. Definitions and rules are taken from the websites of Gilad Feldman and Stuart Ritchie.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I understand a minor error to be, for example, the incorrect reporting of a numerical result. On the other hand, typos or grammatical errors do not count unless they significantly change the meaning of what is being said. <strong>If you find a minor error in my work, I offer to pay you USD 5.</strong></li>
  <li>I understand a major error to be, for example, a flaw in my method, an error in my code that significantly changes the results, or an erroneously drawn conclusion that is not supported by the data. <strong>If you find a major error in my work, I offer to pay you USD 50.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As both Gilad Feldman and Stuart Ritchie note, they “have to be <em>objective</em> errors – not matters of opinion or interpretation.” All errors found in my preprinted and published work will be collected in a separate section of this website.</p>

<h2 id="replicate-my-work">Replicate My Work</h2>

<p>Should you be interested in replicating my work, there are a few things I do to make this as easy as possible for you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For projects where I am the first or corresponding author, I try to maintain repositories containing all the essential files.</li>
  <li>If anything is missing in a repository, please feel free to contact me, and I will try to add the missing files if possible.</li>
  <li>If you are working on replicating my work, I will be happy to give you feedback and answer any questions you have.</li>
</ul>
