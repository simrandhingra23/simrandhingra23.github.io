## Research Projects

- **BODIPY- TKI Bioconjugates for specific targeting of EGFR**
  - *Aug 2021 - Jan 2023*
  - Louisiana State University, Department of Chemistry
  - Supervisor: Prof. Graca Vicente
  - Details:
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>Boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes are well-known for their excellent photophysical properties that have led to their successful applications in fluorescence imaging and chemical sensing. Tyro- sine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are well-known for their ability to specifically bind the intracellular kinase domain of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).</div>
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>The combination of these two agents in a single conjugate allows for diagnosis of cancer cells that overexpress EGFR.</div>

- **Design, synthesis and characterisation of Aza-BODIPY-TKI-peptide bioconjugates**
  - *Ongoing Project*
  - Louisiana State University, Department of Chemistry
  - Supervisor: Prof. Graca Vicente
  - Details:
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>Aza-dipyrromethene boron difluoride or aza-BODIPYs have shown 90nm red shift in both ab- sorption and emission wavelengths in the near- infrared region as compared to their BODIPY analogues. Thus, making these aza-BODIPYs, a very important class of fluorophores for early detection of cells that overexpress EGFR. These aza-BODIPYs can be conjugated to various other biomolecules like TKIs and peptides that show high affinity towards the EGFR.</div>
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>The combination of these three agents in a single conjugate is expected to enhance diagnosis and treatment of cancer cells that overexpress EGFR.</div>

- **Chlorin e<sub>6</sub>-nevirapine Conjugates for dual HIV and PDT treatments**
  - *Ongoing Project*
  - Louisiana State University, Department of Chemistry
  - Supervisor: Prof. Graca Vicente and Prof. Vincent Licata
  - Details:
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>Chlorins, especially chlorin e<sub>6</sub> derivatives, are well-known photosensitizers for the photodynamic treatment (PDT) of tumors and inactivation of viruses because of their ability to generate singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species upon light activation. Nevirapine is a well-known and widely used therapeutic drug for the treatment and prevention of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1).</div>
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>The combination of these two agents in a single conjugate is hypothesized to be an efficient dual PDT-HIV photosensitizer.</div>

- **Synthesis and study of Crystal structure properties of various nitroquinoline derivatives**
  - *Jan 2018 - May 2018*
  - Panjab University, India
  - Supervisor: Dr. Deepak B Salunke and Dr. Subhash Chandra Sahoo
  - Details:
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>Several studies focus on the synthesis and pharmacological evaluations of nitroquinoline analogues but lack evaluation of the crystalline structure of these molecules.</div>
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>In my research, new chemical entities with 3-nitroquinoline framework were synthesized by installing a different amine at C-4 of the 3-nitroquinoline moiety and their novel crystal structureproperties were thoroughly investigated.</div>

- **Design and Synthesis of Imidazoquinoline derivatives as novel human Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)-7/8 modulators**
  - *Jan 2018 - May 2018*
  - Panjab University, India
  - Supervisor: Dr. Deepak B Salunke and Prof. S.K Mehta
  - Details:
    - <div style='text-align: justify;'>In this research I developed a new synthetic route to 1-benzyl-2-butyl-1H- imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline- 4- amine, an extremely potent Toll-Like receptor-7 (TLR7) agonist, with the aim to improve the synthetic yield and reduce the overall cost of its synthesis, allowing for extensive exploration of its biological activity.</div>
